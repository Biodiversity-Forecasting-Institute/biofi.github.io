# Biodiversity and Biosphere Forecasting Institute (Bio<sup>2</sup>FI)

Loss of biodiversity is a threat to human well being. 

Human well-being and security is strongly connected to the richness or loss of biodiversity. Loss of biodiversity impacts human security in the form of water, food and health, and conversely policies and actions to ensure security of water and energy resources can significantly compromise biodiversity. As such, biodiversity is central to some of the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs) targeting zero hunger, good well-being, life below water and on land and climate action. Our group focuses on science to assess the consequences of changing and losing biodiversity across spatial and temporal scales and forecasting its effects on ecosystem function, and consequently human well-being.
