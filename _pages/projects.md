### Understanding Emerging Hazards
Given the crucial role the rise of COVID-19 has played in our lives over the past year, we chose to shift some of our modeling resources to understanding COVID spread globally. The same spatial modeling and machine learning skills, along with fluency in remote sensing products and disease spread that enable us to do ecological forecasting are also well suited for studying COVID spread. Our team has produced three manuscripts exploring global patterns of COVID spread early in the pandemic. The <a href = "https://www.pnas.org/content/117/44/27456.abstract">first paper</a> was the first to detect a signal of the negative effects of UV on spread rate, while cautioning that this effect was insufficient to protect against irresponsible human behavior during summer (predictions made in April 2019, which were unfortunately correct). A <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720349305">second paper</a> quantified the role of intervention on COVID spread by using remotely sensed N2 emissions to quantify socioeconomic activity (or lack thereof) as a proxy for widespread intervention. A <a href = "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.29.20202416v1">third paper</a> looks at whether virus evolution has contributed significantly to differences in spread in different countries/states across the world. In particular, we have found evidence that spike protein structure from two of the five accepted clades considered has correlated well with higher growth rates.
