# Projects

### Cascading Hazards in Australia
We studied the impacts of drought and fire on all plant species in Australia during the record breaking 2019-20 fires. This work is ongoing but is notable because we have leveraged a collaboration with the lead of the Australian assessment team, <a href = "https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/rachael-gallagher">Rachael Gallagher</a>, to use our work to guide prioritization of management and monitoring and recovery efforts post-fire. This has resulted in a ‘white paper’ report to the Australian government and will guide funding initiatives to advance monitoring of high-risk species.11

To better understand how a series of ‘cascading environmental hazards’ may work in concert to alter vegetation dynamics in Australia, we are working on two projects that will help to understand and then forecast vegetation dynamics post fire. In the first, we are examining how post-fire biomass recovery is influenced by post-fire floods that drain systems of the resources needed for recovery. In the second, we are examining what factors drive variation in fire severity (2019-20 was noted for particularly devastating high severity fires) so that we can forecast the return times of extreme years such as 2019-20.

### Global Change Impacts on Amazonian Biodiversity
As part of our objective to provide rapid assessments of ecological disasters and forecast their impacts, we have assessed the catastrophic and widespread fires in the Amazon in 2019. We assessed how fire losses and the species they impact have changed over the past two decades based on high resolution remote sensing data. 

### Understanding Emerging Hazards
Given the crucial role the rise of COVID-19 has played in our lives over the past year, we chose to shift some of our modeling resources to understanding COVID spread globally. The same spatial modeling and machine learning skills, along with fluency in remote sensing products and disease spread that enable us to do ecological forecasting are also well suited for studying COVID spread. Our team has produced three manuscripts exploring global patterns of COVID spread early in the pandemic. The <a href = "https://www.pnas.org/content/117/44/27456.abstract">first paper</a> was the first to detect a signal of the negative effects of UV on spread rate, while cautioning that this effect was insufficient to protect against irresponsible human behavior during summer (predictions made in April 2019, which were unfortunately correct). A <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720349305">second paper</a> quantified the role of intervention on COVID spread by using remotely sensed N2 emissions to quantify socioeconomic activity (or lack thereof) as a proxy for widespread intervention. A <a href = "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.29.20202416v1">third paper</a> looks at whether virus evolution has contributed significantly to differences in spread in different countries/states across the world. In particular, we have found evidence that spike protein structure from two of the five accepted clades considered has correlated well with higher growth rates.
