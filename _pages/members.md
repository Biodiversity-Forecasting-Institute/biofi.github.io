### Brian J. Enquist
Making allometry great again.

### Amy E. Frazier

Amy is an Assistant Professor and core faculty in the Spatial Analysis Research Center (SPARC), School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning, an affiliate faculty in the Center for Biodiversity Outcomes, and a Senior Sustainability Scientist in the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability at Arizona State University.

Amy’s research focuses on the integration of remote sensing, GIScience, and landscape ecology to study global environmental change. Specifically, she investigates how advances in GIS and remote sensing classification science can be used to overcome the challenges that result when using remote sensing or aggregated GIS data to study ground-based phenomena at different spatial scales. 


### Cory Merow
*If it has more than one point, he can model it.*

Cory is a quantitative ecologist interested in forecasting population, community, and ecosystem responses to environmental change. Even the best data sets are imperfect for predicting global change responses, so he develops tools to combine data sources to gain insights into how biological systems may change.


### Laura Duncanson
Return of the GEDI.

Bad at websites.

### Patrick R. Roehrdanz
*Manager, Spatial Planning for Area Conservation in Response to Climate Change (SPARC)*

Moore Center for Science, Conservation International

<img src="https://github.com/Biodiversity-Forecasting-Institute/biofi.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/Roehrdanz.jpg?raw=true" alt="Patrick" width=200 />

Patrick R. Roehrdanz is the manager of Spatial Planning for Area Conservation in Response to Climate Change (SPARC) at Conservation International, where he examines how to effectively conserve the world’s biodiversity as species and ecosystems respond to a changing climate.  

Patrick brings over a decade of experience in spatial analysis with a focus on climate change, including species distribution modeling, ecosystem services impact evaluation, climate change vulnerability assessment, agricultural suitability modeling and conservation planning.   

Patrick grew up in Fargo, ND and holds degrees in environmental science and management from University of California, Santa Barbara and geology from Carleton College in Minnesota.
