### Amy E. Frazier

Amy is an Assistant Professor and core faculty in the Spatial Analysis Research Center (SPARC), School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning, an affiliate faculty in the Center for Biodiversity Outcomes, and a Senior Sustainability Scientist in the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability at Arizona State University.

Amy’s research focuses on the integration of remote sensing, GIScience, and landscape ecology to study global environmental change. Specifically, she investigates how advances in GIS and remote sensing classification science can be used to overcome the challenges that result when using remote sensing or aggregated GIS data to study ground-based phenomena at different spatial scales.

### Brian S. Maitner
*Postdoctoral Scholar, Speculative Macroecology Group, University of Connecticut*

Brian is broadly interested in the forces that generate and maintain biodiversity across different groups of organisms.

### Cory Merow
*University of Connecticut*

Cory is a quantitative ecologist interested in forecasting population, community, and ecosystem responses to environmental change. Even the best data sets are imperfect for predicting global change responses, so he develops tools to combine data sources to gain insights into how biological systems may change.

### Thymios Nikolopoulos
Thymios is Assistant Professor in Hydrology and Water Resources at the department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering at Florida Institute of Technology. His work focuses on the integration of climate data from remote sensing and global climate models with numerical and statistical modeling to advance understanding and predictability of the changes of water cycle components. Specifically, he develops global hazard layers and utilizes state-of-art statistical approaches to investigate the changes in severity, duration and frequency of climate extremes and associated hazards (droughts and floods) at global scale.


### Patrick R. Roehrdanz
*Manager, Spatial Planning for Area Conservation in Response to Climate Change (SPARC)*

Moore Center for Science, Conservation International

<img src="https://github.com/Biodiversity-Forecasting-Institute/biofi.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/Roehrdanz.jpg?raw=true" alt="Patrick" width=200 />

Patrick R. Roehrdanz is the manager of Spatial Planning for Area Conservation in Response to Climate Change (SPARC) at Conservation International, where he examines how to effectively conserve the world’s biodiversity as species and ecosystems respond to a changing climate.  

Patrick brings over a decade of experience in spatial analysis with a focus on climate change, including species distribution modeling, ecosystem services impact evaluation, climate change vulnerability assessment, agricultural suitability modeling and conservation planning.   

Patrick grew up in Fargo, ND and holds degrees in environmental science and management from University of California, Santa Barbara and geology from Carleton College in Minnesota.

### Haruko Wainwright

<img src="https://github.com/Biodiversity-Forecasting-Institute/biofi.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/Wainwright.png?raw=true" alt="Haruko" width=200 />

Haruko Wainwright’s research focuses on environmental informatics, aiming to improve understanding and predictions in Earth and environmental systems through mechanistic modeling and machine learning. In particular, she has been developing methodology to integrate multi-type and multiscale datasets (e.g., point samples, geophysical data, and drone/airborne/satellite remote sensing data) for estimating spatially heterogeneous subsurface and ecosystem properties. She works on broader topics, including watershed science, Arctic ecosystem science, agricultural ecosystem science, environmental contamination and remediation, and radiation monitoring.
